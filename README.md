# Water-Quality-GAE

Contains a web app developed to analyse real time water quality at Arizons State University.

1. Frontend developed using angular 
2. Backend server in python

We fetch data from Google datastore. The water sensors collects water quality parameters every 5 minutes and sends the readings to google cloud. We use that data to analyse and make recommendations whether the water is suitable for drinking or not.

We have hosted our app -> https://release-dot-ninth-tensor-233119.appspot.com/

We also have a researcher view to get raw data -> https://release-dot-ninth-tensor-233119.appspot.com/researcher
